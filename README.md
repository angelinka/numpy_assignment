## Description

This repository was created to complete the assessment for Programming for Data Analysis course by utilising Jupyter notebooks.

## Explore

There is one main file in this repository:
`numPy.ipynb` provides an overview of the numpy.random package in Python. It explains the use of the package, including detailed explanations of five distributions which come in the package : normal, uniform, binomial, poisson and exponential. It also explains the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

Additional files/folders:
- README.md
- Images folder - contans numPy logo
- requirements text file - requirements.txt
- a gitignore file - .gitignore

## How to install the notebook

You need to run this notebook in python environment (please refer to packages and dependencies in requirements.txt file) the easiest way to do that is to install Anaconda
1. Download [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html). If not using Anaconda can install packages via ***pip install / homebrew install*** (Example: pip install matplotlib).
2. Download [cmder](https://cmder.net) if using Windows. Or use Terminal if on macOS or Linux.

## How to run the notebook

1. Open terminal / cmder.
2. Run command `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from command line. It's a web application which runs on your local machine (you will be able to see the server running in Terminal/cmder). To stop the application running press control+c and then type 'y' to confirm.
3. The browser page should open up automatically. Select the file you would like to view.

Ypu can also start `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from Anaconda-Navigator.

You can view the notebook in static or dynamic form by clicking the following images:
