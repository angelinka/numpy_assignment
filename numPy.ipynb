    "NumPy, stands for Numerical Python \"is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\" [numpy.org](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/whatisnumpy.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant who incorporating features of the Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications. NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**`numpy.random`** is a module within the NumPy package which is used to generate pseudo-random values and provides a range of tools to  manipulate them. This module is similar to the Python standard library random but it works with numpy arrays.  It allows to create arrays of random numbers from various probability distributions and also randomly sample from arrays or lists. This module is frequently used to fake or simulate data which is an important tool in data analysis, scientific research, machine learning and multiple other areas. The simulated data becomes very handy as it can be used to test methods before applying them to the real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's standard library random  only samples one value at a time while numpy.random can efficiently generate arrays of sample values from various probability distributions and provides additional probability distributions to use. Numpy's random module is much faster and more efficient than the standard Python’s random library particularly when working with lots of samples, however for other simpler purposes the random module can be sufficient and even more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "As computers cannot generate truly random numbers - they need a set of instructions to produce an output, that means they are predictable and reproducible which is beneficial when creating and testing code. Therefore both of the random modules can only produce what is called  pseudorandom numbers that may appear random but they are not truly so.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Random number generators have applications in gambling, statistical sampling, computer simulation, cryptography, completely randomized design, and other areas where producing an unpredictable result is desirable.” Monte Carlo simulation uses random numbers to simulate real world problems. They are often used to assess the risk of a given trading strategy for options or stocks. A Monte Carlo simulator allow to visualize most of the potential outcomes which gives a much better idea regarding the risk of a decision. They are also used in cryptography – so long as the seed is secret. Sender and receiver can generate the same set of numbers automatically to use as keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine learning random sampling  is often used an actual datasets for testing and evaluation analytical methods and algorithms. “Machine learning is about learning some properties of a data set and then testing those properties against another data set. A common practice in machine learning is to evaluate an algorithm by splitting a data set into two. We call one of those sets the training set, on which we learn some properties; we call the other set the testing set, on which we test the learned properties.”  The machine learning algorithms in the scikit-learn package use numpy.random in the background. \n",
    "[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. There are many different patterns of probability and random numbers can be drawn from various probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distributions are of two types:\n",
    "1. Discrete Probability Distribution\n",
    "2. Continuous Probability Distribution or Probability Density Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete random variable is one where its set of possible values is a collection of isolated points on the number line - it has a finite set of specific outcomes, while a continuous random variable is one where its set of possible values is an entire interval on the number line. Discrete random variables almost always come from counting while continuous random variables mostly come from measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distributions are used widely in data analytics, statistical analysis and machine learning. They can be simulated based on their mathematical properties. Probability distributions are derived from variance or uncertainty and show which outcomes are more likely and which are less likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very long list of various probability distribution which can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions). In this project we going to have a look at a five of most commonly used ones as example. \n",

    "[Normal distribution](https://www.britannica.com/topic/normal-distribution), also known as Gaussian Distribution represents the behavior of most situations in the universe. It is the most important probability distribution in statistics for independent, random variables.  It has a symmetric, bell shaped density curve which is described by its mean 𝝁 and standard deviation 𝝈. It represents things like IQ Scores, heartbeats, people's heights and weights, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`numpy.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.Generator.normal.html#numpy.random.Generator.normal) function generates random number in a bell shaped curve centred around zero but spread out according to the scale parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters are used in the function:\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:Blue; font-weight:bold;\">loc</span> argument is used to specify the mean or the centre of the distribution (peak of the bell curve)\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:Blue; font-weight:bold;\">scale</span> is used to specify the standard deviation of the distribution (distance from the mean)\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:Blue; font-weight:bold;\">size</span> is the number of random variables to sample (shape of the array)\n",
    "\n",
    "If no paremters are passed, a single value will be returned using a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This is  known as standard normal distribution and numpy.random has a separate standard_normal() function which only takes a size as a parameter and leaves the mean and standard at 0 and 1 respectively. Let's have a look at both of the examples below:"
